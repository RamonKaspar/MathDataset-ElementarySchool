      "Explanation": "first calculate the surface area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width of the rectangle together , then multiply by 2 to get both sides of the rectangle . this calculates to 12 inches . find the surface area of the sides of the rectangular cube . multiply the height by the length of the rectangle . multiply the answer by 2 ( for the 2 sides on the rectangular cube ) . this calculates to 3 inches . then multiply the width of the rectangle by the height . multiply the answer by 2 ( for the 2 sides on the rectangular cube ) . this calculates to 2 inches . add the totals together to get the rectangular cube surface area of 17 inches . since a square cube has 6 sides , divide the surface area by 6 . this calculates to 2.833 inches as the surface area of each side of the cube . the square root of 2.833 is 1.683 . rounding to the nearest whole number that makes each side of the cube measuring 2 inches . the correct answer is ( e ) ."

( remember , a square is a rectangle too and the problem works the same way when you assume different values for length and width . computation becomes a bit tedious with different values for length and width ) area of a rectangle = length * width = 100 * 100 = 10,000 sq units . when the length increases by 10 % , the new length becomes 110 units . and as the width decreases by 10 % , new width becomes 90 units . therefore , new area = 110 * 90 = 9900 sq units . new area is 100 sq units lesser than the original area . % change in area = ( ( change in area ) / ( original area ) ) * 100 = ( 100 / 10,000 ) * 100 = 1 % decrease in area the correct choice is ( d )\""

( 8 - 3 ) ! ) = 56 , so , groups with at least 1 triangle = 220 - 56 = 164 answer : c"

      "Explanation": "let \u2019 s call the two perfect squares x ^ 2 and y ^ 2 , respectively . then the given information translates as x ^ 2 + 148 = y ^ 2 . subtracting x ^ 2 gives 148 = y ^ 2 \u2212 x ^ 2 , a difference of squares . this , in turn , factors as ( y + x ) ( y \u2212 x ) = 148 . the next step is tricky . it begins with factoring 148 , which breaks down as 2 \u2217 2 \u2217 37 . since we \u2019 re dealing with perfect squares , x and y are positive integers , and ( y + x ) and ( y \u2212 x ) must be paired integer factors of 148 . the options are 148 \u2217 1,74 \u2217 2 , and 37 \u2217 4 . but our number properties establish that ( y + x ) and ( y \u2212 x ) must be either both odd or both even , so only 74 \u2217 2 is an actual possibility . and because for any positive integers ( y + x ) > ( y \u2212 x ) , we can conclude that y + x = 74 and y \u2013 x = 2 . solving by elimination , 2 y = 76 , y = 38 , and x = 36 . finally , we just need to square 36 . but rather than multiplying it out , note that 36 ^ 2 ends in 6 \u2013 as does only one answer , choice a . this answer must be the one we want ."
