**The original data and the arithmetic_complete files are too big for github.**

All data files and scripts are hosted on our Google Drive, available for download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/104Vp0L2E1TPfKkVW1SJdrAyHiYLVHhRm?usp=sharing). To conserve space and facilitate easier downloading, all resources are compiled into a `data.zip` file.
